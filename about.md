My name's Mike Powell. I live in Tucson, Arizona. Iâ€™ve written for the New York Times Magazine, the Paris Review, Grantland, the Ringer, the Oxford American, Vulture/New York. I've also written a lot about music for Pitchfork; you can find that stuff [here](https://pitchfork.com/staff/mike-powell/).
