My name's Mike Powell. I’m a freelance writer and copywriter with 20 years of paid experience at big, corporate environments like the _The New York Times_ and Apple down to literary nonprofits and small art galleries. I’ve written essays and reported features for _The New York Times Magazine_, The Ringer, _The Paris Review_, _Oxford American_, and dozens of other publications on subjects ranging from the joys of dishwashing to the state of Hollywood stuntwork in the era of motion-capture animation. I've also written hundreds of reviews and features for the long-running, ASME-nominated music site Pitchfork, all of which you can find [here](https://pitchfork.com/staff/mike-powell/). 

Most of my working hours these days are at Apple's streaming-music service, Apple Music, whose tone and character I have helped shape through the design and writing of album notes, features, playlist and banner copy, CTAs and the like, often incorporating expectations from corporate and design teams alongside editorial initiatives. I live in Tucson, Arizona, and am always looking for new opportunities.
