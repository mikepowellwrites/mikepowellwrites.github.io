A few examples of feature work I've conceptualized and written for Apple Music: 

About [The Beatles] (https://music.apple.com/us/multi-room/1651468217). Or [Frank Ocean](https://music.apple.com/us/multi-room/1632462027). Or [the Oscars] (https://music.apple.com/us/multi-room/1613787330). 

And here's some other work I'm proud of. 

A [short essay for _The New York Times Magazine_](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/04/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-washing-dishes.html) about dishwashing.

An [archive of columns](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/tag/zonies/) I wrote for _the Paris Review_ about living in Arizona.

A [long story](https://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/reader/natural-selection/) about the first guy to sell nature sounds (or, at least, fabricated nature sounds) as relaxation aids, for Pitchfork.

A [long exploration of meditation apps](https://www.theringer.com/tech/2018/10/25/18010314/meditation-headspace-insight-timer-apps) and some Zen stories, for the Ringer.

A [profile of a motion-capture stuntman](http://grantland.com/features/stuntman-hollywood-motion-capture-reuben-langdon/) who happens to love aliens, for Grantland.

A [profile](http://grantland.com/features/ariel-rechtshaid-producer-vampire-weekend-haim-sky-ferreira-snoop-lion-justin-bieber/) of a brilliant and unconventional record producer named Ariel Rechtshaid, for Grantland.

And because I lost so much sleep over them, [a meditation on train horns](https://theconcourse.deadspin.com/train-horns-that-keep-my-wife-and-i-awake-at-night-ran-1686084634) that blow in my neighborhood.
