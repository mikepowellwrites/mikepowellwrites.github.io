My name's Mike Powell. I’m a freelance writer and copywriter with 20 years of paid experience at corporate environments like the The New York Times and Apple down to literary nonprofits and small art galleries. I’ve written essays and reported features for _The New York Times Magazine_, The Ringer, _The Paris Review_, _Oxford American_, and dozens of other publications on subjects ranging from [the joys of dishwashing](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/04/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-washing-dishes.html) to the state of Hollywood stuntwork in the era of [motion-capture animation](http://grantland.com/features/stuntman-hollywood-motion-capture-reuben-langdon/). 

I've also written hundreds of reviews and features for the long-running, ASME-nominated music site Pitchfork, all of which you can find [here](https://pitchfork.com/staff/mike-powell/) (and my favorite of which is [here](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/silver-jews-american-water/)). 

Most of my working hours these days are at Apple's streaming-music service, Apple Music, whose tone and character I have helped shape through the design and writing of album notes, features, playlist and banner copy, CTAs and the like, often incorporating expectations from corporate and design teams alongside editorial initiatives. I live in Tucson, Arizona.

## Selected Work

Here are some examples of features I've conceptualized and written for Apple Music: 

About the [history and legacy of hip-hop producers](https://music.apple.com/us/multi-room/6446378857) and [MCs](https://music.apple.com/us/multi-room/6446378801). Or [The Beatles](https://music.apple.com/us/multi-room/1651468217). Or [Frank Ocean](https://music.apple.com/us/multi-room/1632462027). 

And here's some other work I'm proud of: 

An [archive of columns](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/tag/zonies/) I wrote for _the Paris Review_ about living in Arizona.

A [long story](https://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/reader/natural-selection/) about the first guy to sell nature sounds (or, at least, fabricated nature sounds) as relaxation aids, for Pitchfork.

A [long exploration of meditation apps](https://www.theringer.com/tech/2018/10/25/18010314/meditation-headspace-insight-timer-apps) for the Ringer.

A [profile](http://grantland.com/features/ariel-rechtshaid-producer-vampire-weekend-haim-sky-ferreira-snoop-lion-justin-bieber/) of a brilliant and unconventional record producer named Ariel Rechtshaid, for Grantland.

And because I lost so much sleep over them, [a meditation on train horns](https://theconcourse.deadspin.com/train-horns-that-keep-my-wife-and-i-awake-at-night-ran-1686084634) that blow in my neighborhood.

Do you want to talk about contemporary American hardcore? Soto Zen? The unyielding challenges - and incomparable rewards - of parenting? Work? These are some subjects I am invested in. Please feel free to [email me](mailto:revelatory@gmail.com).
